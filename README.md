Analyzing and visualizing patterns of censorship on Wikipedia.

## **Project Title and Team**
- **Title:** Tracking Wikipedia Edits on Controversial Topics  
- **Team:** Sohan Mulamalla â€“ smulamalla  
*Note:* Exception granted by TA Anna Lorimer to complete the project individually because of a late join through add/drop.

## **Project Summary**
- **What is the problem?**  
Identifying patterns of censorship or bias in Wikipedia edits regarding politically sensitive topics is essential.

- **Why is it an important problem?**  
Wikipedia shapes public knowledge. Hidden moderation and editing bias weaken the reliability of information.
- **What kinds of actions could be taken based on your results?**  
We need to increase transparency, explain moderation policies, and focus on sensitive topics.
- **Who is equipped to take those actions?**  
Wikipedia editors, researchers, policymakers, and digital rights advocates can make good use of this knowledge.

## **Related Work**
**References (so far):**  
- Studies on Wikipedia edit wars and bias, like those from Ford & Geiger in 2012.  
- Citizen Lab reports on online censorship.  
- OONI and Censored Planet provide data on information control.  
*These works help us collect and compare information on censorship methods.*

## **Project Preparation and Prerequisites**
- **What do you need to complete this project?**  
Access to the Wikipedia API, Python for data analysis, and visualization tools like Plotly and NetworkX is essential.
- **If your project is measurement-based, what data do you need to collect?**
I examine edit histories, revision timestamps, and metadata from controversial Wikipedia pages.
- **What results are you expecting?**  
I expect to see clear patterns of deletions, reverts, and spikes in editing activity on sensitive topics.

- **How would you present these results?**  
I will achieve this through interactive timelines and network visualizations of editor activity.

## **Evaluation**
- **What is your evaluation process?**  
I validate our findings by checking edit patterns across multiple topics and comparing them with known censorship events.


---

## **Ethics**
- **What are the ethical implications of your work?**  
Potential exposure of individual editor activity; must anonymize and aggregate data.  
- **Will your models suffer from any kind of bias?**  
Possible topic selection and sampling bias.  
- **Will this potential bias impact the fairness of any proposed solutions?**  
These findings may overrepresent censorship in certain regions or languages; thus, they must be placed in context.
